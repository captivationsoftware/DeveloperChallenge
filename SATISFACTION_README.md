# SATISFACTION_README

## To run:
1. Download Python 3.8+. I suspect it will work on older versions, but have not tested this on older versions.
2. Download python script to any directory.
3. Open a terminal
4. Navigate to the location of the downloaded python script.
5. Run the script using the command ` sudo python3 SATISFACTION.py `
6. Start feeding it binary data. The program runs in an infinite loop, so to quit press ` Ctrl + C `
