# Captivation Challenge by Kevin Wilson 

## Installation 

This project can be run directly without downloading the dev dependancies by running 

```
cd app
node app.js
```

In order to install and run, you will need to run the following commands 

```
npm install 
npm start 
```


Note: there is a known limitation of input streams that are greater than 1000 characters.  I tried using readLine but it was hogging up the memory.
